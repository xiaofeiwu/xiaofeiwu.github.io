= Sparse Shape Reconstruction

== Aim
- Formulate mask optimization as an inverse shape optimization problem, instead of an inverse imaging problem.
- Note a more significant contribution lie in a new formulation, instead of a new solution. With this new formulation, bettern performance can be obtained, while solutions can be borrowed from sparsity constraint nonlinear optimizaiton.

== Ideas
- To construct the basis matrix for mask optimization, use similar idea as the paper in SSR do, and construt basis with rectangle with different sizes.
- What does less measurement means? Is it possible to use less number of pixel in the target aerial image (pattern)? If so, then it can be possible to reduce the number of constraints, and thus the basis function matrix can be significantly reduces.
- Use basis like shot, the "sparsity" can have concrete practical meaning.

== Notes
- the symbol $\sigma$ is the noise level, for fidelity term
- the symbol $\tau$ is the sparsity term, meausing the sparsity of the coefficient $\alpha$
- the function $\phi(x, \alpha)$ is a parametric function to characterize the shape

== Questions
- In Eq.~(3.8), an iterative method is used to update $\tau$ to solve problem (3.4). But why do we need this step; what information is obtained for further optimization.
- Chan and Vese measure: The inhomogeneity measures $r_{in}$ and $r_{ex}$of $u$ in each region. What is the physical meaning?


== Gains
- The Paretor curve (Figure 5) shows a trade-off between the residual error and the $l_1$\-norm of the solution.
